I explored the power of Azure for data management and Power BI for data visualization. In this project, I set up SQL Server in Azure and created a database to manage and analyze large datasets. Using Azure Data Studio, I designed tables and populated them with over 1,000 rows of data, ensuring everything was structured to support insightful queries and reporting.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the steps I followed:
- Set up SQL Server in Azure and created a database.
- Used Azure Data Studio to design tables and populate them with over 1,000 rows of data.
- Connected the database to Power BI to create dynamic visualizations.
- Published the visualizations to Power BI Service for cloud access and sharing.
- Embedded the Power BI dashboards into a custom HTML page, creating a live, accessible webpage.

This project has been a great way to integrate cloud-based data management and visualization tools to create a seamless and interactive data experience.
